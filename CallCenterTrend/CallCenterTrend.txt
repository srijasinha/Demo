Call Center Trend Dashboard-

Objective:In this project Create a dashboard in Power BI for the call center manager that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset.

Possible KPIs include:

1)Overall customer satisfaction
2)Overall calls answered/abandoned
3)Calls by time
4)Average speed of answer
5)Agentâ€™s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered

Data Cleaning:

Call Centre Trends dataset is give table named:
Call Center Trends dataset which has 10 columns and 5000 rows of observation
Data Cleaning for the dataset was done in the power query editor as follows:

1)Removed Unnecessary columns
2)Removed Unnecessary rows
3)Each of the columns in the table were validated to have the correct data type

Data Modeling:

And then dataset was cleaned and transformed, it was ready to the data modeled.

Data Analysis (DAX): and Functional Requirement:

1)Total Calls = SUMX(CallCenterData,CallCenterData[AnsweredCalls] + CallCenterData[UnAnsweredCalls])

2)Total call Answerd = SUM(CallCenterData[AnsweredCalls])

3)Total call UnAnswerd = SUM(CallCenterData[UnAnsweredCalls])

4)Avg speed of answerd calls = AVERAGE(CallCenterData[Speed of answer in seconds])

5)Possitive satisfaction Rateing = CALCULATE(COUNT('CallCenterData'[Satisfaction rating]),FILTER('CallCenterData','CallCenterData'[Satisfaction rating] IN {4,5}))

6)Customer satisfaction rateing = DIVIDE([Possitive satisfaction Rateing],COUNT(CallCenterData[Satisfaction rating]),0)

Dashboard Design: Page1 (call center Trend)

1)Add card to show - a)Total calls 
                     b)Total AnsweredCalls
					 c)Total UnAnsweredCalls
					 d)Average speed od answered calls
					 e)Overall customer Satisfaction
				
2) Add slicer - a)By Month
                b)Topic
				c)Agent
				
3) Stack column chart- Total calls by satisfaction Rateing

4)Donut chart- Total calls by topic of all the day

5)Line chart - Speed of answers in seconds by Agent

Dashboard Design: Page2 (Agent Performance)

1)1)Add card to show - a)Call Answered
                     b)Total UnAnsweredCalls
					 c)Recieved calls
					 d)Resolved calls
				     e)Average speed od answered calls
					 
2) Add slicer - a)By Month
                b)Topic
				c)Agent
				
3) Line chart- Total calls by Day

4)Stack column chart- Speed of answers in seconds by Agent

5)Stacked bar chart- Average of Speed of answered calls by Agent
