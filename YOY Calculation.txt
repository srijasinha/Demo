Question 1)To calculate YOY Variance%

1) crreate Measure(DAX) function of
 Total Revenue = SUMX(Purchase['Revenue])

SUMX - returns an expression sum of each row


2)Create a Measure (DAX) function to find the Previous Year Revenue

Previous Year Revenue = CALCULATE([Total Revenue],DATEADD(Calender['DATE'],-1,Year)
 
 Calendar['DATE'] - Date column of Calender table
 -1 - 1 year back of calendar table date column
 Year - calculation based on year-wise interval

3) To calculate YOY Variance 

YOY Variance = [Total Sales] - [Previous Year Revenue]

4) YOY Variance %

YOY Variance % = DIVIDE([YOY Variance],Previous Year Revenue)

 Date Function -

TotalSales = SUM(balances[Amount])

Current MTD = TOTALMTD([TotalSales],DATESMTD(balances[Dates]))

Current QTD = TOTALQTD([TotalSales],DATESQTD(balances[Dates]))

Current YTD = TOTALYTD([TotalSales],DATESYTD(balances[Dates]))

Previous MTD = CALCULATE([TotalSales],PREVIOUSMONTH(DATESMTD(balances[Dates])))

Previous QTD = CALCULATE([TotalSales],PREVIOUSQUARTER(DATESQTD(balances[Dates])))

Previous YTD = CALCULATE([TotalSales],PREVIOUSYEAR(DATESYTD(balances[Dates])))

SPLY MTD = CALCULATE([Current MTD],SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(balances[Dates]))

SPLY QTD = CALCULATE([Current QTD],SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(balances[Dates]))

SPLY YTD = CALCULATE([Current YTD],SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(balances[Dates]))


5)What is Query Folding?
Ans -In power query in applied steps where we perform transformation on data (like, rename, delete) convert an M language(mashup language) to a native data source language(SQL).

6)What is DAX?
Ans - Data Analysis Expression is a library of functions and operators used to perform calculations on data or measures. 

7)What are the 3 modes of data connection?
Ans - 1)Import method
      2)Live Query
      3)Direct Query
8)How to handle text scenarios in Power BI?
Ans - In the order table we have order ID - CA-2020-234222 - Canada(Ca) is the country code,2020 is the year,234222 is the ID 
      Solution - Separate this by using the first two characters or by Deliminator, Range (Use Extract option at Top)

9)When and which visuals are used?
